v0.4.2 (June 29, 2019)
----------------------

This is a minor release from 0.4.1. We recommend that all users update to
maintain compatibility with IEX Cloud and optimize message weighting in calls.

Highlights:

- Removes support for the legacy Version 1.0 IEX Developer API, which was
  retired in favor of IEX Cloud in June 2019
- Optimized retrieval of historical prices with ``get_historical_data`` to
  allow for close prices only and single day charts to reduce message counts

New Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data APIs**

- /time-series (``get_time_series``)
- /data-points (``get_data_points``)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds logging for queries, including message count usage and debugging
  information. Logging level defaults to ``WARNING``, but can be set to other
  levels through the ``IEX_LOG_LEVEL`` environment variable. The following
  levels provide various information:

    - ``WARNING`` - errors only
    - ``INFO`` - message count used
    - ``DEBUG`` - request information

- Add ``close_only`` keyword argument to ``get_historical_data`` to allow for
  retrieval of adjusted close only at reduced message cost (through
  ``chartCloseOnly`` query parameter)
- Optimize ``get_historical_data`` to use ``chartByDay`` if a single date is
  passed which reduces message count (thanks shlomikushchi)

Backwards Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When ``IEX_API_VERSION`` is set to ``v1``, IEX Cloud will now be used, and
  as such this has the same behavior as ``iexcloud-v1``
- The following legacy-only endpoints have been deprecated and will raise an
  ``ImmediateDeprecationError`` when called:

    - ``iexfinance.stocks.get_crypto_quotes``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_iex_corporate_actions``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_iex_dividends``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_iex_next_day_ex_date``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_listed_symbol_dir``
    - ``iexfinance.stocks.Stock.get_effective_spread``

- The ``get_all`` method of ``iexfinance.stocks.Stock`` has been immediately
  deprecated


Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Certain failed requests which erroneously-returened ``IEXAuthorizationError``
  now return ``IEXQueryError``
