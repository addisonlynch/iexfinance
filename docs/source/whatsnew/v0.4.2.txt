v0.4.2 (June 29, 2019)
----------------------

This is a minor release from 0.4.1. We recommend that all users update to
maintain compatibility with IEX Cloud.

Highlights:

- Removes support for the legacy Version 1.0 IEX Developer API, which was
retired in favor of IEX Cloud in June 2019


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- When ``IEX_API_VERSION`` is set to ``v1``, IEX Cloud will now be used, and
  as such this has the same behavior as ``iexcloud-v1``
- The following legacy-only endpoints have been deprecated and will raise an
  ``ImmediateDeprecationError`` when called:

    - ``iexfinance.stocks.get_crypto_quotes``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_iex_corporate_actions``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_iex_dividends``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_iex_next_day_ex_date``
    - ``iexfinance.refdata.get_listed_symbol_dir``
