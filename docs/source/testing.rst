Sandbox Environment
-------------------

IEX provides a sandbox_ environment for IEX Cloud. This environment can be accessed by setting ``IEX_API_VERSION`` to ``iexcloud-sandbox``. This will set ``iexfinance`` up for use with the sandbox base URL.

.. note:: Test keys (beginning with ``Tsk`` and ``Tpk``) must be used with the sandbox environment. To obtain these keys, select the "Viewing test data" toggler on the left side of the IEX Cloud console.

.. _testing.local_testing:

Local Testing
-------------

We've provided the BASH script ``test.sh`` which is included in the
top-level iexfinance directory. This script will emulate the tests
needed for a TravisCI build to pass.

Docs can be tested with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable>`__ (with extensions napoleon and sphinx_rtd_theme)
using the Makefile. ``make livehtml`` will serve the dev documentation site locally
on 127.0.0.1:8000.

``highweight``.
