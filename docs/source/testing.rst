Local Testing
-------------

We've provided the BASH script ``test.sh`` which is included in the
top-level iexfinance directory. This script will emulate the tests
needed for a TravisCI build to pass.

Docs can be tested with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable>`__ (with extensions napoleon and sphinx_rtd_theme)
using the Makefile. ``make livehtml`` will serve the dev documentation site locally
on 127.0.0.1:8000.
