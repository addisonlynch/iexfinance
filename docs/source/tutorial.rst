Tutorial
========

Setting up a new environment
----------------------------

Ideally, before installing or using iexfinance, we'll create a new
virtual environment using
`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__. This will ensure
that our packages are isolated from other projects and configured
correctly.

.. code:: bash

    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate

Getting started
---------------

Once our environment is created, we can now install iexfinance. We do so
by the following from iexfinance's pypl repository.

.. code:: bash

    (env) $ pip install iexfinance

This will install the latest stable release of iexfinance that is ready
for use. Once installed, we can import the library and begin downloading
data!
